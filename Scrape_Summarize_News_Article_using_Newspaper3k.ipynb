In the long run, people could learn rapidly any kinds of skills and abilities as [easily] as just downloading skill knowledge from the Internet as shown in science fiction movies, for example, The Matrix”.\n",

For example, such devices could let us actively monitor our performance in work settings and feed that information to BMIs that adaptively tailor custom solutions to improve performance.\n",

            "Alexander von Lühmann, a postdoctoral researcher collaborating with David Boas, the founding director of the Neurophotonics Center and world leader in the field of neurophotonics, explains that in the last five years, there has been a great surge in interest in developing wearable neurotechnologies and getting them outside the lab, but one major challenge is how to detect clear signals in all the noise of everyday life. “There’s an increase in studies that are trying to get these technologies outside of the lab. There’s a lot of challenges to address, not only on the instrumentation side but also on the signal processing, artifact rejection, and signal analysis part,” says von Lühmann. von Lühmann is tackling this challenge by integrating functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) into wearable equipment.\n",

            "EEG has the advantage of relatively precise temporal measurements because it measures the brain’s immediate electrical activity whereas fNIRS measures the oxygen levels of blood in the brain, which is delayed by a few seconds. But fNIRS has the upper hand in terms of spatial accuracy, and it is more robust to several measurement artifacts. “EEG picks up a lot of electrophysiological noise, eye movements, neck muscles, etc.,” von Lühmann explains. “With fNIRS you don’t have that kind of interference … there’s still some interference, we can tackle that.” By combining the technologies in one device, they can take advantage of each technology’s strengths.\n",

            "Boas and von Lühmann are hopeful that the integration of fNIRS will help neurotechnology make the move from portable to wearable and even possibly unnoticeable. On the difference between portable and wearable, von Lühmann explains, “On the portable side you still have something chunky, but it’s not really tethered so you can wear it in a backpack, wearable goes more towards what you know from Fitbits or those more unobtrusive small devices that aim, at least in some point in the future, to provide measurements without really impacting natural behavior.”\n",

            "Boas and von Lühmann have developed these technologies as part of a wider plan called “Neuroimaging in the Everyday World (NEW)”. NEW aims to create an unobtrusive wearable device that would provide a multi-modality overview of what is happening in your brain at any moment in your everyday life. You could be at work, talking with a friend, or having lunch, and this device would be recording a video and audio stream of what you’re seeing and hearing while monitoring your brain activity and biosignals including EEG, fNIRS, your head movements, and your eye movements. What you see would be automatically labelled with the aid of computer vision and a cloud-based image annotation service. “It will incorporate technologies that are already out there, but so far not yet combined very well,” says von Lühmann.\n",

            "von Lühmann, who has a background in BMIs, also gives perspective on how the interfaces could advance by utilizing the new wearables, as BMIs also face the challenge of working properly when taken out of the laboratory and into the real world. Recent research in neuroergonomics suggests a passive application of BMIs which could use the new wearables “to assess mental or cognitive states and use that as support for systems that give feedback to the human, like for operator work load monitoring,” explains von Lühmann. Research into this area has already begun, with studies “where basically EEG and now more and more also fNIRS have been used to assess cognitive workload in air traffic controllers, in surgeons in training, in many different areas,” says von Lühmann. “That is in a way an extension of the original understanding [of BMIs] because it is not using the signals for an active control input [e.g., to control a robotic arm or wheelchair] but rather for monitoring and adapting the system to what the operator or person within that system needs.”\n"
